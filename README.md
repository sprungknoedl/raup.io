# raup.io
raup.io is an anonymous instant proxy service

**THIS IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT!**

## What is raup.io?
raup.io is similar to any normal HTTP proxy, except that it requires neither installation nor configuration to be used. Just point your browser to the raup.io URL and enter your start URL into the field. All pages are transparently downloaded by the proxy. Every page is transformed so you don't accidentally send requests to the server yourself.

The philosophy is to provide as much protection as possible. In order to guarantee that, some features like javascript and flash will therefore be removed from the target sites.

## Server wanted
raup.io is designed to be run as an globally accesible web service, so any user in need of quick and instant privacy can use it. I'm currently looking for a thrustworthy and free/cheap hosting solution. If you have one spare ;), please contact me.
